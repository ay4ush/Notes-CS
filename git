# Git & GitHub Commands Notes

## ⚡ Most Used Commands

- **`git status`**  
  **Description:** Checks the current state of your working directory and staging area. It lets you know which files have been modified, added, or deleted.
  - `-s` : (**Short**) Gives the output in a concise, short-format, making it easier to scan when many files are changed.

- **`git add .`**  
  **Description:** Adds *all* changes in the current directory and its proper subdirectories to the staging area. This prepares them to be included in the next commit.
  - `-A` or `--all` : Stages **all** changes in the entire repository (including file deletions and new files), regardless of which directory you are currently in.
  - `-p` : (**Patch**) Interactively allows you to review and stage changes hunk-by-hunk. Great for when you've done too much work in one file and only want to commit part of it.

- **`git commit -m "msg"`**  
  **Description:** Captures a snapshot of the currently staged changes. This saves your work to the local repository history.
  - `-m "msg"` : Allows you to provide a commit message directly in the command line.
  - `-a` : (**All**) Automatically stages files that have been modified or deleted, but *ignores* new files that haven't been told to Git yet.
  - `--amend` : Modifies the *most recent* commit. It combines the currently staged changes with the previous commit and allows you to rewrite the commit message. Useful for fixing small typos immediately.

- **`git push`**  
  **Description:** Sends your committed changes from your local repository to a remote repository (like GitHub).
  - `-u origin <branch>` : (**Upstream**) Sets the upstream link mostly used on the first push of a new branch. It tells Git that your local branch corresponds to the remote branch, so you can just type `git push` or `git pull` later without arguments.
  - `-f` or `--force` : **Dangerous**. Forces the push even if it results in a non-fast-forward merge. This will overwrite history on the remote server.
  - `--tags` : Pushes all tags (like version numbers) to the remote, as they aren't pushed by default.

- **`git pull`**  
  **Description:** Fetches changes from a remote repository and immediately merges them into your current local branch. It is essentially `git fetch` followed by `git merge`.
  - `--rebase` : Instead of a standard merge, it reapplies your local commits *on top* of the incoming changes. This keeps a linear project history which is cleaner.

- **`git clone <url>`**  
  **Description:** Downloads an entire existing repository from a remote URL, including all files, branches, and version history, into a new directory on your machine.
  - `--depth 1` : (**Shallow Clone**) Fetches only the most recent commit history (depth of 1). drastically speeds up cloning for large repositories if you don't need the full history.

- **`git branch`**  
  **Description:** Your tool for managing branches. Running it alone lists all local branches.
  - `-d <branch>` : (**Delete**) safe deletes the branch. It prevents deletion if the branch has unmerged changes.
  - `-D <branch>` : (**Force Delete**) Forces the branch deletion even if it contains unmerged work.
  - `-a` : (**All**) Lists both local branches and remote-tracking branches.
  - `-m <old> <new>` : (**Move/Rename**) Renames a branch from old name to new name.

- **`git checkout <branch>`**  
  **Description:** Switches your working directory to the specified branch. It updates files in your working tree to match the version stored in that branch.
  - `-b <new-branch>` : Creates a **new** branch and immediately switches to it.

- **`git merge <branch>`**  
  **Description:** Takes the history of the specified independent branch and integrates it into the current branch you are working on.
  - `--abort` : If conflicts occur during a merge, this command stops the process and returns the file state to what it was before you started the merge.
  - `--no-ff` : (**No Fast-Forward**) Forces Git to create a merge commit even if a fast-forward merge is possible. This preserves the topology of the feature branch in history.

- **`git log`**  
  **Description:** Displays the commit history log.
  - `--oneline` : Condenses each commit to a single line containing just the hash and the message.
  - `--graph` : Adds a text-based ASCII graph to the left of the messages, visualizing branch and merge history.
  - `-n <number>` : Limits the output to show only the last `<number>` commits.
  - `--stat` : Shows statistics for each commit, specifically which files changed and how many lines were added/removed.

---

## 🛠️ Setup & Configuration

- **`git config`**
  **Description:** Gets and sets repository or global options that control Git's look and operation.
  - `--global` : Saves the configuration changes to your user-level `.gitconfig` file (applies to all your projects).
  - `--list` : Lists all specific configuration settings currently in use.

- **`git init`**
  **Description:** Creates an empty Git repository or reinitializes an existing one. It creates a `.git` folder changes version tracking.

## 🔄 Undoing Changes

- **`git reset`**
  **Description:** Reset current HEAD to the specified state. This is a powerful command with three main modes for undoing changes.
  - `--soft <commit>` : Moves the HEAD pointer back to `<commit>`, but leaves your changes staged ("index"). Good for squashing commits.
  - `--mixed <commit>` : (Default) Moves HEAD to `<commit>` and unstages changes, but keeps the files modified in your working directory.
  - `--hard <commit>` : **Destructive**. Moves HEAD to `<commit>` and wipes out all pending changes in both the staging area and working directory.

- **`git restore <file>`**
  **Description:** Restore working tree files. A newer, safer alternative to `checkout` for files.
  - `--staged` : Unstages the file (removes it from the staging area) but leaves the changes in your working directory.

- **`git clean`**
  **Description:** Recursively removes files that are not under version control, starting from the current directory.
  - `-n` : (**Dry Run**) Shows you exactly which files *would* be removed without actually deleting them.
  - `-f` : (**Force**) Required to actually delete the files (unless configuration is changed).
  - `-d` : Also removes untracked directories.

## 📦 Stashing (Temporary Storage)

- **`git stash`**
  **Description:** Temporarily saves changes that are not ready to be committed, allowing you to switch branches without losing your work.
  - `save "message"` : Stashes changes with a custom message so you can remember what they are later.
  - `pop` : Applies the mostly recently stashed changes back to your workspace and deletes them from the stash list.
  - `apply` : Applies the changes but keeps a copy in the stash list (useful if you want to apply the same stash to multiple branches).
  - `list` : displays the list of all current stashes.
  - `drop` : Discards the most recent stash (or a specific one if ID provided) permanently.

## 🔍 Inspection & Comparison

- **`git diff`**
  **Description:** Shows changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc.
  - `--staged` (or `--cached`) : Displays the changes that you have staged for the next commit relative to the last commit.
  - `--name-only` : Summarizes the output by showing only the names of changed files, rather than the content differences.
