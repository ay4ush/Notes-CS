# Load Balancer vs API Gateway vs Reverse Proxy

## 1. Load Balancer
**Definition:** A Load Balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. It improves application responsiveness, availability, and fault tolerance.

### Key Functions
- **Traffic Distribution:** Spreads requests using algorithms like Round Robin, Least Connections, or IP Hash.
- **Health Checks:** Periodically checks if backend servers are online and removes unhealthy ones from the pool.
- **High Availability:** Redirects traffic away from failed servers to ensure continuous uptime.
- **SSL Offloading:** Can handle SSL encryption/decryption to reduce load on backend servers.

### Types by Layer
- **Layer 4 (Transport Layer):** Routes based on IP address and Port (TCP/UDP). Faster but less intelligent.
- **Layer 7 (Application Layer):** Routes based on content (URL, Headers, Cookies). More intelligent but heavier processing.

## 2. Reverse Proxy
**Definition:** A Reverse Proxy sits in front of backend servers and forwards client requests to them. Unlike a **Forward Proxy** (which acts on behalf of a client/user to access the internet), a Reverse Proxy acts on behalf of the server.

### Key Features
- **Security:** Hides the identity and private IP addresses of backend servers. Attacks hit the proxy, not the server.
- **SSL Termination:** Decrypts incoming requests and communicates with backend servers via HTTP (or HTTPS), saving backend resources.
- **Caching:** Caches static content (images, CSS) to speed up response times and reduce load.
- **Load Balancing:** Basic load balancing capabilities are often included.

## 3. API Gateway
**Definition:** An API Gateway is a specialized Reverse Proxy designed specifically for microservices architectures. It acts as a single entry point for all API calls.

### Key Functions
- **Single Entry Point:** Aggregates multiple microservices into a unified API endpoint for the client.
- **Routing:** Routes requests to the appropriate specific microservice (e.g., `/users` -> User Service, `/orders` -> Order Service).
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Handles identity verification (JWT, OAuth) centrally so individual services don't have to.
- **Rate Limiting:** Protects backend services from overuse or DDoS attacks by limiting requests per user/IP.
- **Protocol Translation:** Can convert between protocols (e.g., HTTP/JSON to gRPC or SOAP).

## 4. Comparison Summary

| Feature | Load Balancer | Reverse Proxy | API Gateway |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Goal** | Distribute traffic (Availability) | Security & Anonymity | API Management & Routing |
| **Scope** | One Service (Horizontal Scaling) | One or More Web Apps | Microservices Architecture |
| **Placement** | Front of Server Pool | Front of Web Server | Front of Microservices |
| **Awareness** | Server Health & Load | Content Caching & Protection | Business Logic & API Rules |

### How they work together
In a complex system, these components are often layered:
1. **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic to multiple Gateway/Proxy instances.
2. **Reverse Proxy / API Gateway**: Handles security, auth, and routing to specific services.
3. **Internal Load Balancer**: (Optional) Distributes traffic among instances of a specific microservice.
