IP Address: 
    It's the address of website over Internet
DNS:
    Domain Name System : It's the registry that links IP addresses to a domain name
Ports:
    Ports are basically ways to hit different services on in a single server
    using different doors.
Segmentation:
    ->When everything is on single server it becomes a security issue
    ->Hence Segmentation sets different parts of the applications that is
      different services on different servers.
    ->Since services are working on differnet servers ROUTING is used for services
      to speak with each others.
    ->Firewalls are setup between each routes to accept traffic from only necessary servers
Subnets:
    ->It's a Network inside another Network.
    ->It usually have IP Addresses as follows:
      10.0.1.x
    ->Subnets allow servers to be stay hidden from public network and allows only
      the necessary server to face the public internet
NAT:
    ->It is a module that sits outside the private Subnets
    ->If Subnet needs the make API call over internet, It can
      send request to NAT and that'll make the API call(Public IP expensive and it's more secure ofc)
    ->NAT is basically a recieptionist for private subnets.
