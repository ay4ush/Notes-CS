# Computer Networks Basics

## 1. IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)
**Definition:** A unique numerical label assigned to every device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

### Versions
- **IPv4:** 32-bit number (e.g., `192.168.1.1`). Limited to ~4 billion addresses.
- **IPv6:** 128-bit number (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`). Virtually unlimited addresses.

### Types
- **Public IP:** Assigned by ISP, visible to the internet.
- **Private IP:** Used within a local network (e.g., `10.x.x.x`, `192.168.x.x`). Reserved by IANA and not routable on the public internet.
- **Static IP:** Fixed address that doesn't change.
- **Dynamic IP:** Assigned automatically by DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) and changes periodically.

## 2. DNS (Domain Name System)
**Definition:** The "phonebook" of the internet. It translates human-readable domain names (like `google.com`) into IP addresses (like `142.250.190.46`).

### Hierarchy & Resolution
1. **Recursive Resolver:** The first stop (usually ISP). Checks cache or asks other servers.
2. **Root Server:** Knows where to find the TLD servers (Top Level Domain like `.com`, `.org`).
3. **TLD Server:** Point to the Authoritative Name Server for the specific domain.
4. **Authoritative Name Server:** Holds the actual DNS records (A, CNAME, MX) and returns the final IP.

## 3. Ports
**Definition:** Virtual endpoints for network connections. They allow a single server to host multiple services by directing traffic to the correct application "door".

### Categories
- **Well-Known Ports (0-1023):** Reserved for system services.
- **Registered Ports (1024-49151):** User processes or applications.
- **Dynamic/Private Ports (49152-65535):** Ephemeral ports for client-side connections.

### Common Ports Table
| Port | Protocol | Service |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 21 | FTP | File Transfer |
| 22 | SSH | Secure Remote Login |
| 53 | DNS | Domain Name Resolution |
| 80 | HTTP | Unsecured Web Traffic |
| 443 | HTTPS | Secured Web Traffic (TLS/SSL) |

## 4. Network Segmentation
**Definition:** Dividing a computer network into smaller parts (subnetworks or segments) to improve performance and security.

### Benefits
- **Security:** Limits the spread of cyberattacks. If one segment is compromised, others remain safe.
- **Performance:** Reduces congestion by limiting broadcast traffic to local segments.
- **Compliance:** Helps separate sensitive data (e.g., PCI-DSS requiring payment data isolation).

### Implementation
- **VLAN (Virtual LAN):** Logical segmentation at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer).
- **Subnets:** Segmentation at Layer 3 (Network Layer) using IP addressing.

## 5. Subnets (Subnetworks)
**Definition:** A logical subdivision of an IP network.

### Key Concepts
- **Subnet Mask:** A 32-bit number (e.g., `255.255.255.0`) that divides the IP address into network and host portions.
- **CIDR Notation:** A compact representation (e.g., `/24` means the first 24 bits are the network).
- **Function:** Allows administrators to hide internal network structure and routing complexity from the external world. Devices in different subnets need a router to communicate.

## 6. NAT (Network Address Translation)
**Definition:** A method to remap one IP address space into another. It typically allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address.

### Types
- **Static NAT:** One-to-one mapping (1 Private IP = 1 Public IP). Used for servers needing external access.
- **Dynamic NAT:** Maps a private IP to the next available public IP from a pool.
- **PAT (Port Address Translation) / NAT Overload:** Maps multiple private IPs to a single public IP using unique source ports. This is the most common home/office setup.

### Role ("The Receptionist")
- **Security:** Hides internal IP structure. External traffic sees only the NAT device's public IP.
- **Economy:** Conserves public IPv4 addresses.
